# Rennie Gaming: SA-MP Server Landing Page.

This is the Landing Page I designed back in **April(?) 2017**. Rennie RPG was my first big project and I was getting familiar with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Webpack-Yeoman. It was a fun experience.

You can have the source files, as they are just prototypes and they don't include any sensitive information.

_Note that I was also a founder on this project. I'm not sharing anything, that was not my own._
